# STAT 547T at UBC: Replicability 

In 2024, I decided to teach a new graduate topics course at UBC Statistics on "modern inference", i.e. multiple testing and selective inference. I wanted this course to have broad appeal, being useful and interesting to two crowds: 

1. Students looking to do (methods or theory) research in modern inference, and 
2. Students looking to understand the area and learn how to use modern inference methods to analyze data and solve scientific problems. 

I found that there was a lot of material seemingly targeted at Crowd 1 (textbooks, courses, presentations, slides, notes, papers), especially in selective inference. These typically involve detailed treatments of proofs and deep dives into the math behind specific methods, which is not so great for Crowd 2. 

I found some material seemingly targeted at Crowd 2, especially in multiple testing. These were typically made for  domain scientists (e.g. genomics researchers) and consequently shorter and less in-depth than was appropriate for a statistics graduate student, or even for a domain scientist looking to get a deeper statistical understanding of the area. 

[Nothing seemed to be the right fit!](https://twitter.com/BetterCallSaul/status/702517442845736960) So I rolled up my sleeves and decided to make all the material from scratch. 

**This repository contains the very first iteration of the course (UBC Term 2024W2), with all the polish issues and mistakes that implies!** Any feedback you might have is welcome!
